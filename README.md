# KG_representations
This code base is a part of a research project to explore the effects of different RDF/JSON representations on querying Knowledge Graphs (`KG`). To this end, we designed and developed a parser to convert KG datasets from RDF/N-Triples syntax to the five different JSON collections (`See Parser directory`). We ran our experiment using the publicly available Berlin SPARQL Benchmark by loading the different representations corresponding to a KG into MongoDB by mapping it onto the relevant JSON documents. The benchmark queries (`See Queries directory`) were executed over each of the JSON representations separately and query execution times computed to analyze the effects of the different representations on KG query performance. Our results (`See Results directory`) indicate that the representation type has a significant performance impact on query execution. In particular, subject-oriented RDF/JSON KG representations outperform predicate-oriented representations by around 4 orders of magnitude. 

Please note that to run the parser, it is needed to set the path of input RDF/N-Triples KG dataset within the source code. The parser can be compiled using GNU C++ Compiler, e.g., g++ -std=c++11 `SNV.cpp` -o runSNV (`SNV.cpp` is the developed parser to generate the Subject-oriented Name/Value (SNV) representation of a given KG).
